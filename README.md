# Emperor and Slave Game

## Concept

This game is inspired by the "Emperor and Slave" card game seen in *Kaiji*.  
Two players face off, each with a different set of cards:

- **Player 1** has:
  - 1 Emperor 🏛️
  - 3 Citizens 👤

- **Player 2** has:
  - 1 Slave 🔗
  - 3 Citizens 👤

Each player chooses one of their remaining cards secretly each round.  
The cards are then revealed, and the winner of the round is determined based on the following rules:

---

## Game Logic

- **Citizen vs Citizen** → Draw (no winner)
- **Citizen vs Slave** → Citizen wins
- **Citizen vs Emperor** → Emperor wins
- **Slave vs Emperor** → Slave wins

---

## Additional Rules

- After each **Draw** (Citizen vs Citizen), one Citizen card from each player is **removed** to make the game faster.
- The game continues until:
  - One player wins a decisive round.
  - Or if all cards are exhausted without a clear winner.

---

## How to Play

- Each player selects one card per round without seeing the opponent's choice.
- If a player wins, a victory message appears.
- If it's a draw, a message appears and Citizen cards are reduced.
- The interface allows switching between **Arabic (AR)** and **English (EN)** easily.
- The game offers a professional and fun background matching the Emperor and Slave theme.
